Rate limiting middleware for [Hono](https://hono.dev/). Use to
limit repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset.

> [!NOTE]  
> The `keyGenerator` function needs to be defined for `hono-rate-limiter` to work properly in your environment. Please ensure that you define the `keyGenerator` function according to the documentation before using the library.

## Installation

```sh
# Using npm/yarn/pnpm/bun
npm add hono-rate-limiter
```

## Usage

### Rest APIs

```ts
import { rateLimiter } from "hono-rate-limiter";

const limiter = rateLimiter({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  limit: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per `window` (here, per 15 minutes).
  standardHeaders: "draft-6", // draft-6: `RateLimit-*` headers; draft-7: combined `RateLimit` header
  keyGenerator: (c) => "<unique_key>", // Method to generate custom identifiers for clients.
  // store: ... , // Redis, MemoryStore, etc. See below.
});

// Apply the rate limiting middleware to all requests.
app.use(limiter);
```

### WebSocket APIs

```ts
import { webSocketLimiter } from "hono-rate-limiter";
import { upgradeWebSocket } from "hono/cloudflare-workers";
import { RedisStore } from "@hono-rate-limiter/redis";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis/cloudflare";

const limiter = webSocketLimiter({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  limit: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per `window` (here, per 15 minutes).
  keyGenerator: (c) => "<unique_key>", // Method to generate custom identifiers for clients.
  store: new RedisStore({ client }), // Define your DataStore. See below.
});

// Apply the rate limiting middleware to ws requests.
app.get(
  "/",
  upgradeWebSocket(
    limiter((c) => {
      return {
        onOpen: () => {
          console.log("Connection opened");
        },
        async onMessage(event, ws) {
          console.log(`Message from client: ${event.data}`);
          ws.send("Hello from server!");
        },
        onClose: () => {
          console.log("Connection closed");
        },
      };
    })
  )
);
```

## Data Stores

`hono-rate-limiter` supports external data stores to synchronize hit counts across multiple processes and servers.

By default, `MemoryStore` is used. This one does not synchronize its state across instances. Itâ€™s simple to deploy, and often sufficient for basic abuse prevention, but will be inconsistent across reboots or in deployments with multiple process or servers.

Deployments requiring more consistently enforced rate limits should use an external store.

Here is a list of stores:

Take a look at this [guide](https://express-rate-limit.mintlify.app/guides/creating-a-store) if you wish to create your own store.

## Notes

- The `keyGenerator` function determines what to limit a request on, it should represent a unique characteristic of a user or class of user that you wish to rate limit. Good choices include API keys in `Authorization` headers, URL paths or routes, specific query parameters used by your application, and/or user IDs.
- It is not recommended to use IP addresses (since these can be shared by many users in many valid cases) or locations (the same), as you may find yourself unintentionally rate limiting a wider group of users than you intended.

## Examples

- [hono-rate-limiter.vercel.app](https://hono-rate-limiter.vercel.app) - Uses Vercel KV and deployed on Vercel
- [hono-rate-limiter.rhinobase.workers.dev](https://hono-rate-limiter.rhinobase.workers.dev) - Built using Cloudflare Workers
